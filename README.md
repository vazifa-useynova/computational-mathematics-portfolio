# Computational Mathematics Portfolio

**Vazifa Useynova** | Computer Engineering Student @ Baku Higher Oil School  
*Specializing in Applied Mathematics, Numerical Methods, and Inverse Problems*


## Overview
This portfolio showcases implementations of numerical algorithms and research code from my studies in computer engineering and applied mathematics. The focus is on **robust, well-documented implementations** that demonstrate both theoretical understanding and practical application.

## Project Structure

### Numerical Methods
- **Linear Algebra**: Gaussian elimination with partial pivoting, condition number analysis
- **Interpolation**: Lagrange polynomial implementation
- *Algorithms implemented from scratch with complexity analysis*

### Inverse Problems Research
- **Tikhonov Regularization**: For ill-posed system stabilization
- **Synthetic Data Generation**: For method validation
- *Code excerpts from my research on industrial inverse problems*

### Engineering Applications
- **Circuit Analysis**: Solving linear systems from Kirchhoff's laws
- **Heat Equation**: Basic finite difference solver
- *Bridging mathematical theory with engineering practice*
